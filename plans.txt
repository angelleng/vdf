TODO:
- Merkle tree:
    -- refactor old proof method
    -- store tree on disk for new method
- Hygiene:
    -- make omitHeight and filename of gs arguments
    -- refactor code, make functions in vdf.go interact with disk directly, get rid of evalKey etc.
- Implement Bloom filters for verification on L
